## Types

The CE builder methods definition can involve not 2 but 3 types:

* The wrapper type `M<T>`
* The `Delayed<T>` type
* An `Internal<T>` type

### `M<T>` wrapper type

‚òùÔ∏è We use the generic type notation `M<T>` to indicate any of these aspects: generic or container.

Examples of candidate types:

* Any generic type
* Any monoidal, monadic, or applicative type
* `string` as it contains `char`s
* Any type itself as `type Identity<'t> = 't` ‚Äì see previous `logger {}` CE

### `Delayed<T>` type

* Return type of `Delay`
* Parameter to `Run`, `Combine`, `While`, `TryWith`, `TryFinally`
* Default type when `Delay` is not defined: `M<T>`
* Common type for a real delay: `unit -> M<T>` - see `member _.Delay f = f`

#### `Delayed<T>` type example: `eventually {}`

Union type used for both wrapper and delayed types:

```fsharp
// Code adapted from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions
type Eventually<'t> =
    | Done of 't
    | NotYetDone of (unit -> Eventually<'t>)

type EventuallyBuilder() =
    member _.Return x = Done x
    member _.ReturnFrom expr = expr
    member _.Zero() = Done()
    member _.Delay f = NotYetDone f

    member m.Bind(expr, f) =
        match expr with
        | Done x -> f x
        | NotYetDone work -> NotYetDone(fun () -> m.Bind(work (), f))

    member m.Combine(command, expr) = m.Bind(command, (fun () -> expr))

let eventually = EventuallyBuilder()
```

The output values are maint to be evaluated interactively, step by step:

```fsharp
let step = function
    | Done x -> Done x
    | NotYetDone func -> func ()

let delayPrintMessage i =
    NotYetDone(fun () -> printfn "Message %d" i; Done ())

let test = eventually {
    do! delayPrintMessage 1
    do! delayPrintMessage 2
    return 3 + 4
}

let step1 = test |> step   // val step1: Eventually<int> = NotYetDone <fun:Bind@14-1>
let step2 = step1 |> step  // Message 1 ‚Ü© val step2: Eventually<int> = NotYetDone <fun:Bind@14-1>
let step3 = step2 |> step  // Message 2 ‚Ü© val step3: Eventually<int> = Done 7
```

### `Internal<T>` type

`Return`, `ReturnFrom`, `Yield`, `YieldFrom`, `Zero` can return a type internal to the CE. `Combine`, `Delay`, and `Run` handle this type.

```fsharp
// Example: list builder using sequences internally, like the list comprehension does.
type ListSeqBuilder() =
    member inline _.Zero() = Seq.empty
    member inline _.Yield(x) = Seq.singleton x
    member inline _.YieldFrom(xs) = Seq.ofList xs
    member inline _.Delay([<InlineIfLambda>] thunk) = Seq.delay thunk
    member inline _.Combine(xs, ys) = Seq.append xs ys
    member inline _.For(xs, [<InlineIfLambda>] f) = xs |> Seq.collect f
    member inline _.Run(xs) = xs |> Seq.toList

let listSeq = ListSeqBuilder()
```

üí° Highlights the usefulness of `ReturnFrom`, `YieldFrom`, implemented as an _identity_ function until now.

## Builder methods without type

This is another trick regarding types: Any type can be turned into a CE by adding builder methods as extensions.

### Example: `activity {}`

The prupose of the `activity {}` CE is to configure an `Activity` without passing the instance.

Here are its special traits:

* Type with builder extension methods: `System.Diagnostics.Activity`
* Return type: `unit` (no value returned)
* Internal type involved: `type ActivityAction = delegate of Activity -> unit`
* CE behaviour:
  * monoidal internally: composition of `ActivityAction`
  * like a `State` monad externally, with only the setter(s) part

```fsharp
type ActivityAction = delegate of Activity -> unit

// Helpers
let inline private action ([<InlineIfLambda>] f: Activity -> _) =
    ActivityAction(fun ac -> f ac |> ignore)

let inline addLink link = action _.AddLink(link)
let inline setTag name value = action _.SetTag(name, value)
let inline setStartTime time = action _.SetStartTime(time)

// CE Builder Methods
type ActivityExtensions =
    [<Extension; EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)>]
    static member inline Zero(_: Activity | null) = ActivityAction(fun _ -> ())

    [<Extension; EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)>]
    static member inline Yield(_: Activity | null, [<InlineIfLambda>] a: ActivityAction) = a

    [<Extension; EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)>]
    static member inline Combine(_: Activity | null, [<InlineIfLambda>] a1: ActivityAction, [<InlineIfLambda>] a2: ActivityAction) =
        ActivityAction(fun ac -> a1.Invoke(ac); a2.Invoke(ac))

    [<Extension; EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)>]
    static member inline Delay(_: Activity | null, [<InlineIfLambda>] f: unit -> ActivityAction) = f() // ActivityAction is already delayed

    [<Extension; EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)>]
    static member inline Run(ac: Activity | null, [<InlineIfLambda>] f: ActivityAction) =
        match ac with
        | null -> ()
        | ac -> f.Invoke(ac)

// ---

let activity = new Activity("Tests")

activity {
    setStartTime DateTime.UtcNow
    setTag "count" 2
}
```

Details:

* The `activity` instance supports the CE syntax thanks to its extensions.
* The extension methods are marked as not `EditorBrowsable` for proper DevExp.
* Externally, the `activity` is implicit in the CE body, like a `State` monad.
* Internally, the state is handled as a composition of `ActivityAction`.
* The final `Run` enables us to evaluate the built `ActivityAction`, resulting in the change (mutation) of the `activity` (the side effect).

## Custom operations üöÄ

What: builder methods annotated with `[<CustomOperation("myOperation")>]`

Use cases: add new keywords, build a custom DSL ‚Üí Example: the `query` core CE supports `where` and `select` keywords like LINQ

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** you may need additional things that are not well documented:

* Additional properties for the `CustomOperation` attribute:
  * `AllowIntoPattern`, `MaintainsVariableSpace`
  * `IsLikeJoin`, `IsLikeGroupJoin`, `JoinConditionWord`
  * `IsLikeZip`...
* Additional attributes on the method parameters, like `[<ProjectionParameter>]`

## Final words

Let's review the pros and cons of the computation expressions to get the full picture and to make the appropriate decision about writing our own computation expression.

### Benefits ‚úÖ

Computation expressions offer significant advantages for F# developers. They provide **increased readability** through imperative-like code that feels natural while maintaining functional principles. They also **reduce boilerplate** by hiding complex "machinery" behind clean, expressive syntax. Additionally, their **extensibility** allows developers to extend existing CEs or even add the CE syntax support to any type. Finally, we can create **domain-specific languages** (DSLs) to reify domain concepts through custom operations.

### Limits ‚ö†Ô∏è

However, computation expressions come with certain limitations that developers should be aware of. **Compiler error messages** within CE bodies can often be cryptic and difficult to debug, making troubleshooting more challenging. **Nesting different CEs** can make code more cumbersome to work with‚Äîfor example, combining `async` and `result` patterns. While custom combining CEs like `asyncResult` in [FsToolkit](https://demystifyfp.gitbook.io/fstoolkit-errorhandling/#a-motivating-example) offer alternatives, they add complexity. Finally, **writing custom CEs can be challenging**, requiring developers to implement the right methods correctly and understand the underlying functional programming concepts.

### Guidelines üìÉ

* Choose the main **behaviour**: monoidal? monadic? applicative?
  * Prefer a single behaviour unless it's a generic/multi-purpose CE
* Create a **builder** class
* Implement the main **methods** to get the selected behaviour
* Use/Test your CE to verify it compiles _(see typical compilation errors below),_ produces the expected result, and performs well.

```txt
1. This control construct may only be used if the computation expression builder defines a 'Delay' method
   => Just implement the missing method in the builder.
2. Type constraint mismatch. The type ''b seq' is not compatible with type¬†''a list'
   => Inspect the builder methods and track an inconsistency.
```

### Tips üí°

* Get inspired by existing codebases that provide CEs - examples:
  * FSharpPlus ‚Üí `monad`
  * FsToolkit.ErrorHandling ‚Üí `option`, `result`, `validation`
  * [Expecto](https://github.com/haf/expecto): Testing library (`test "..." {...}`)
  * [Farmer](https://github.com/compositionalit/farmer): Infra as code for Azure (`storageAccount {...}`)
  * [Saturn](https://saturnframework.org/): Web framework on top of ASP.NET Core (`application {...}`)
* Overload methods to support more use cases like different input types
  * `Async<Result<_,_>>` + `Async<_>` + `Result<_,_>`
  * `Option<_>` and `Nullable<_>`
